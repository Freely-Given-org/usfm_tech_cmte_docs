If private-use markup extensions are required, it is recommended that any user additions begin with `+\z+` (e.g. `+\zMyMarker+`). Markers in this `+\z+` namespace are not considered part of the USFM standard. USFM processors cannot be expected to handle `+\z+` markup or associated text, and are free to ignore this markup when it is encountered in a text. It will be the application or user's responsibility to support `+\z+` markup in ways which meet a local need. Please consider this carefully before introducing non-standard USFM markup within a scripture translation project text.
