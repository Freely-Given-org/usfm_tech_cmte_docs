Standard Format Markers (SFMs) have been used for many years within the Bible translation community for marking the elements within a digital Scripture text. Over time the backslash-based syntax (`\`) was used in diverging ways. In 2002 a working group within the United Bible Societies produced a specification for a single SFM dialect which facilitated the validation and sharing of Scripture content between teams, organizations and technologies. That specification was called Unified Standard Format Markers, or *USFM*.

*USX* is a companion XML-based syntax which is derived from and closely associated to USFM.
