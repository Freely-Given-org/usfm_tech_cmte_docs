Standard Format Markers (SFMs) have been used for many years within the Bible translation community for marking the elements within a digital Scripture text. Over time the backslash-based syntax (`\`) was used in diverging ways. In 2002 a working group within the United Bible Societies produced a specification for a single SFM dialect which facilitated the validation and sharing of Scripture content between teams, organizations and technologies. That specification was called _Unified Standard Format Markers_, or *USFM*.

With version *3.1*, USFM (_Unified Scripture Format Markup_) standardizes a single xref:doc:index.adoc[content model] which can be equally expressed in backslash-based `\` format markers (USFM-FM), XML (USFM-XML), or JSON (USFM-JSON). The common abbreviation for these expressions are *USFM*, *USX*, and *USJ*.
