Changes in USFM from 1.53 to 2.0.

=== Marker Revisions

* Removed `\pdi` and `\pde, and substitute with embedded text markup (see Additions, below)
* Removed `\wr ...\wr*`. This was really a duplicate of \w …w* used for marking words in the scripture text which are included in the wordlist.
* Removed `\ps`. This is used in conjunction with xref:para:paragraphs/nb.adoc[\nb] to indicate that the paragraph spans the chapter boundary. It should be sufficient to just start the new chapter with `\nb` and use the appropriate paragraph marker for the previous chapter (`\p`, `\m` etc.)

=== Marker Additions

* Add character style xref:char:features/em.adoc[\em ...\em*] for “emphasis”.
* In Peripherals:
** Add `\intro` section to Front Matter (in addition to Preface).
** Add `\maps` (Maps Index) section to Back Matter.
** Define xref:para:identification/books.adoc[books] for FRT, BAK, and OTH rather than using the book names XXA, XXB, and XXC for these materials.
* Add xref:para:titles-sections/sr.adoc[\sr] for marking the text references range listed under a section heading \s.
* Add the following markers for “embedded text” (see example references – not all versions mark these items the same).
** xref:para:paragraphs/pm.adoc[\pm] - Embedded text paragraph
** xref:para:paragraphs/pmo.adoc[\pmo] - Embedded text opening
** xref:para:paragraphs/pmc.adoc[\pmc] - Embedded text closing
** xref:para:paragraphs/pmr.adoc[\pmr] - Embedded text refrain
** xref:para:poetry/qm.adoc[\qm#] - Embedded text poetic line
