A brief explanation of the syntax used throughout this documention is given below.

Most documentation pages for USFM/USX markup contain one or more of the following sections.

* xref:syntax-docs.adoc#_summary[Summary]
* xref:syntax-docs.adoc#_diagrams[Diagrams]
* xref:syntax-docs.adoc#_examples[Examples]
* xref:syntax-docs.adoc#_properties[Properties]
* xref:syntax-docs.adoc#_publication_issues[Publication Issues]

== Summary

A summary of the 1) *type* of markup found in the current documentation section (e.g. xref:para:index.adoc[paragraphs], xref:char:index.adoc[characters]), xref:note:index.adoc[notes], or 2) a *specific instance* of a markup type (e.g. xref:para:paragraphs/p.adoc[p - paragraph], xref:char:features/nd.adoc[nd - Name of God], xref:note:footnote/index.adoc[footnote]).

=== Description

A short description of the markup.

=== Syntax

A summary of the markup syntax is given in both *USFM* and *USX* syntax. The following conventions are used:

* ``++markup++`` : Monospaced text with a grey background is the explicit marker text required.
* #__placeholder__# : Red, italic text is a placeholder. The content which should be provided at the position of the placeholder is described below the syntax summary.
* #__@attribute__# : Required or optional xref:char:attributes.adoc[attributes] are listed as placeholders in red, italic text preceded by an #__@__# symbol.
* #__placeholder__# or #__@attribute__# content which is required is identified by an *** asterisk.

=== Style Type

If the documentation page is for a specific instance of a markup type, a link to the summary documentation for that marker type is given. For example: xref:para:paragraphs/p.adoc[p] is a type of xref:para:index.adoc[Paragraph].

=== Valid In

The xref:doc:index.adoc[document division], xref:para:index.adoc[paragraph], or xref:note:index.adoc[note] type where the selected markup is valid.

=== Added

The version of USFM/USX when this markup was added.

=== Updated

The version of USFM/USX when this markup was updated, corrected, or possibly deprecated.

[NOTE]
====
Throughout this documentation, texts shown between square brackets, with a grey background, in `[monospacedFont]` are the names used for classes or terminals within the USFM/USX RNG schema. These names correspond to the terminal labels shown in syntax diagrams thoughout the documentation.

== Diagrams

'Railroad' diagrams illustrate the syntax for components of the USFM/USX schema. Where a diagram is provided, USFM and USX expressions are given in separate tabs. Railroad diagrams for the xref:para:index.adoc[paragraph] element are shown below:

USX::

======

* Diagrams are read from left to right.
* USFM markup is shown in containers with a green background. USX is shown with a purple background.
* Explicit markup text is shown within quotation marks, or (for USX) within XML wedges `<>`.
* Markup text which matches a regular expression pattern is shown between 2 forward slashes `/.../`
* Markup text from an enumeration of options are shown within a dotted outline.
* Terminals are shown in containers with rounded corners, and labelled in `ALLCAPS`. The defintions for terminal labels are given in the xref:ROOT:glossary.adoc[glossary].
* A container identifying a markup type is shown with square corners, with a label identifying the type (e.g. xref:note:footnote/index.adoc[Footnote], xref:note:crossref/index.adoc[CrossReference], xref:char:index.adoc[Char], xref:ms:index.adoc[Milestone], xref:cv:v.adoc[Verse]).

== Examples

One or more working text examples in USFM, USX, and USJ are given, usually together with a formatting sample. Examples for xref:para:paragraphs/p.adoc[p - paragraph] are shown below:
