== Definition

In USFM/USX, a white space (*_WS_*) character is xref:ROOT:glossary.adoc[defined] by the pattern ``++/(?:++``#$\{ws\}#``++|++``#$\{nl\}#``++|$)/++``, where:

ws:: ``++/[\u0009-\u000D\u0020]/++``
** A single simple whitespace character that may be reduced
nl:: ``++/(?:\u000D?\u000A|\u000D)/++``
** A single newline (as supported by all operating systems)

All other characters, even if formally Unicode whitespace characters, are treated as _content_ characters.

*Significant* or _#content#_ whitespace is considered part of the text of the document. It may be reduced but is not deleted.

*Structural* or _non-content_ whitespace exists either to aid the layout of a source file or to delimit markers. Structural whitespace is explicitly identified in the syntax diagrams and is not part of a `TEXT` terminal.

== Reducing or Eliminating Whitespace

* Whitespace is *reduced* according to these rules:

** Any string of *_WS_* chars including a newline is reduced to a single newline.
** Any string of *_WS_* chars not including a newline is reduced to a single space.

* _#Content#_ whitespace can be *eliminated* when it occurs:

** At the start of any element content.
** At the end of any element content, except inside a xref:char:index.adoc[character] element, when followed by text or another xref:char:index.adoc[character] element.

* Whitespace *canonicalization* is done as follows:

** A newline before a xref:char:index.adoc[character] marker is converted to a space. That space is significant _#content#_.
** Any whitespace before a xref:para:index.adoc[paragraph] marker, including none, is replaced by a newline. This newline is not significant _#content#_.

[NOTE]
====
USX documents contain whitespace that delimits aspects of the XML syntax. XML allows for unlimited whitespace wherever it is permitted in the XML syntax, which is typically added for the purpose of formatting for easier reading ('pretty-printing').
