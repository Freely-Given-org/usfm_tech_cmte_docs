[CAUTION]
.Significant syntax change in USFM/USX 3.x
====
The syntax for defining illustrations in USFM 3 follows the general syntax for providing xref:char:attributes.adoc[character level attributes]. In USFM 1.x and 2.x, markup for illustrations required the content for a collection of parameters to be provided in a specific order, with items separated by a vertical bar (e.g `+\fig_DESC|FILE|SIZE|LOC|COPY|CAP|REF\fig*+`). The use of marker attributes, and the use of a vertical bar as an attribute separator was unique to illustration markup in USFM 1.x and 2.x. In USFM 3 this syntax is _deprecated_ in order to align the markup with the general syntax for xref:char:attributes.adoc[character level attributes].
