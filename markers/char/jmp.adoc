== Summary

Description:: Link text. For associating linking attributes to a span of text.
xref:ROOT:syntax-docs.adoc#_syntax[Syntax]::
* *USFM:* ``++\jmp ++``#__content__#``++|++``#__@link-href @link-title @link-id__#``++\jmp*++``
* *USX:* ``++<char style="jmp" ++``#__@link-href @link-title @link-id__#``++>++``#__content__#``++</char>++``
#link-href#::: Identifies the resource being linked to as a URI. _(default attribute)_
** A user-defined URI prefix can be used to help identify the target resource. For example: `x-prj:` might identify another scripture translation project available within the current editing environment, like `x-prj:RSV52 MAT 3:1-4`.
** User defined URI prefixes must begin with the prefix `x-`.
** When a #link-href# specifies a scripture reference, follow the pattern: `+[A-Z1-4]{3}(-[A-Z1-4]{3})? ?[a-z0-9\-:]*+`. Example: `MAT 3:1-4`, where:
*** Book names is a standard 3-character scripture xref:para:identification/books.adoc[book identifier].
*** The chapter + verse separator is a colon `:`.
*** Verse ranges are indicated using a hyphen.
#link-title#::: Plain text describing the resource being linked to (for example - to display in a tooltip when hovering over the link).
#link-id#::: A unique identifier for a specific content location (i.e. an anchor).
Style Type:: xref:char:index.adoc[Character]
Valid In:: `[xref:doc:index.adoc#doc-book-titles[BookTitles]]`, `[xref:doc:index.adoc#doc-book-intro[BookIntroduction]]`, `[xref:doc:index.adoc#doc-book-intro-end-titles[BookIntroductionEndTitles]]`, `[xref:para:titles-sections/index.adoc[Section]]`, `[Para]` (xref:para:paragraphs/index.adoc[Body Paragraphs], xref:para:poetry/index.adoc[Poetry]), `[xref:para:lists/index.adoc[List]]`, `[xref:para:tables/index.adoc[Table]]`
