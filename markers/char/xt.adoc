== Summary

Description:: Footnote - Note text.
Syntax::
* *USFM:* `+\xt_{content}+`
* *USX:* `+<char style="xt">{content}</char>+`
Attributes:::
** `link-href` - Unambiguously identifies the scripture target reference using a standard scripture reference format. _(default)_
*** Book names must be one a standard xref:para:identification/books.adoc[book identifier]. Chapter verse separator is always a colon `:`. A string of pattern `+[A-Z1-4]{3}(-[A-Z1-4]{3})? ?[a-z0-9\-:]*+`
*** In some scenarios a target reference is written in a format which cannot be accurately parsed and identified. Providing the `link-href` attribute allows greater flexibility in the use of xref:char:notes/crossref/xt.adoc[xt].
*** In this context, `link-href` should only target scripture references for the current text (i.e. references to other project texts or non-scripture URIs are not allowed).
*** When adding `link-href`, the explicit attribute name is not required since it is defined in USFM as the default for xref:char:notes/crossref/xt.adoc[xt].
