\p
\v 5 Now I wish to remind you, although you know everything, that the Lord 
once saved a people out of the land of Egypt, but that afterward he destroyed 
those who did not believe.
\v 6 And angels who did not keep to their own principality, but left their 
proper dwelling place—God has kept them in everlasting chains in darkness for 
the judgment of the great day.
\ts\*
\v 7 It is just like Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, which in 
a similar way gave themselves over to fornication and pursued unnatural 
desires. They were given as examples of those who suffer the punishment of 
eternal fire.
\p
\v 8 Yet in the same way these also pollute their bodies in their dreams, and 
they reject authority, and they say evil things about the glorious ones.
