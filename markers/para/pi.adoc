\s1 Jesus Explains the Story about the Weeds
\p
\v 36 After Jesus left the crowd and went inside, his disciples came to him 
and said, “Explain to us the story about the weeds in the wheat field.”
\p
\v 37 Jesus answered:
\pi The one who scattered the good seed is the Son of Man.
\v 38 The field is the world, and the good seeds are the people who belong to 
the kingdom. The weed seeds are those who belong to the evil one,
\v 39 and the one who scattered them is the devil. The harvest is the end of 
time, and angels are the ones who bring in the harvest.
