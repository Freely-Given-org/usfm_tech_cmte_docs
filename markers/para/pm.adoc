\v 24 We have heard that some people from here have terribly upset you by what 
they said. But we did not send them!
\v 25 So we met together and decided to choose some men and to send them to 
you along with our good friends Barnabas and Paul.
\v 26 These men have risked their lives for our Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 27 We are also sending Judas and Silas, who will tell you in person the 
same things that we are writing.
\pm
\v 28 The Holy Spirit has shown us that we should not place any extra burden 
on you...
