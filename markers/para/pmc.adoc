\v 28 The Holy Spirit has shown us that we should not place any extra burden 
on you.
\v 29 But you should not eat anything offered to idols. You should not eat 
any meat that still has the blood in it or any meat of any animal that has 
been strangled. You must also not commit any terrible sexual sins. If you 
follow these instructions, you will do well.
\pmc We send our best wishes.
