\p
\v 22 The apostles, the leaders, and all the church members decided to send 
some men to Antioch along with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Silas and Judas 
Barsabbas, who were two leaders of the Lord's followers.
\v 23 They wrote a letter that said:
\pmo We apostles and leaders send friendly greetings to all of you Gentiles 
who are followers of the Lord in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia.
\pm
\v 24 We have heard that some people from here have terribly upset you by what 
they said. But we did not send them!
