== Summary

Description:: Semantic division (semantic space). Vertical space used to divide the text into sections, in a manner similar to the structure added through a sequence of heading texts with (ms) or (s). The purpose of `sd#` is distinct from (b) which primarily denotes whitespace (in particular at poetic stanza breaks) and does not imply a hierarchy or division.
- The variable `#` represents the level of division be marked.
Syntax::
- *USFM:* `+\sd#_text...+`
- *USX:* `+<para style="sd#">text...</para>+`
