== Summary

Description:: Semantic division (semantic space). Vertical space used to divide the text into sections, in a manner similar to the structure added through a sequence of heading texts with xref:para:titles-sections/ms.adoc[ms] or xref:para:titles-sections/s.adoc[s]. The purpose of xref:para:titles-sections/sd.adoc[sd] is distinct from xref:para:paragraphs/b.adoc[b] which primarily denotes whitespace (in particular at poetic stanza breaks) and does not imply a hierarchy or division.
* The variable `#` (1-4) represents the level of division be marked.
Syntax::
* *USFM:* ``++\sd# ++``#__content__#
* *USX:* ``++<para style="sd#">++``#__content__#``++</para>++``
Style Type:: xref:para:index.adoc[Paragraph]
Valid In:: `[xref:doc:index.adoc#doc-book-chapter-content[ChapterContent]]` > `[Section]`
// tag::spec[]
Added:: 3.0
// end::spec[]
