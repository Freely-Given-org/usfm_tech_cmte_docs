== Summary

Description:: Semantic division (semantic space). Vertical space used to divide the text into sections, in a manner similar to the structure added through a sequence of heading texts with xref:para:titles-sections/ms.adoc[ms] or xref:para:titles-sections/s.adoc[s]. The purpose of xref:para:titles-sections/sd.adoc[sd] is distinct from xref:para:paragraphs/b.adoc[b] which primarily denotes whitespace (in particular at poetic stanza breaks) and does not imply a hierarchy or division.
* The variable `#` represents the level of division be marked.
Syntax::
* *USFM:* `+\sd#_{content}+`
* *USX:* `+<para style="sd#">{content}</para>+`
// tag::spec[]
Added:: 3.0
