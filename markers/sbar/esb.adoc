\ms Fish and Fishing
\p In Jesus' time, fishing took place mostly on lake Galilee, because Jewish 
people could not use many of the harbors along the coast of the Mediterranean 
Sea, since these harbors were often controlled by unfriendly neighbors. The 
most common fish in the Lake of Galilee were carp and catfish. The Law of 
Moses allowed people to eat any fish with fins and scales, but since catfish 
lack scales (as do eels and sharks) they were not to be eaten (\xt Lev 
11.9-12\xt*). Fish were also probably brought from Tyre and Sidon, where they 
were dried and salted.
...
\p Among early Christians, the fish was a favorite image for Jesus, because 
the Greek word for fish (\tl ichthus\tl*) consists of the first letters of the 
Greek words that tell who Jesus is: \fig Ihsous Christos Theou Uios Swthr|

\v 19 He went a little farther on and saw two other brothers, James and John,
the sons of Zebedee.
